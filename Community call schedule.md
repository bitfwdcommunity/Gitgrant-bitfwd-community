## Community Call Schedule

Hello Gitgrant bitfwd community!

To make the most out of the time we share on the calls and in between working asynchronuously I propose the following structure:

### Check-in (5-8 min)

Each participant to say their name, what and what was their week's highlight. a short 30 seconds would be good.

### Project updates (Optional formats depending on needs)

**Option a: Got product/project?**
Excellent, you've already got your project togeyher and you know what you'd like to share and get feedback on:
- Quick project reminder (30sec - 1 min)
- Specific product feature/topic you'd like to get feedback on (2-4 min)
- Time for feedback and questions (fairly short questions and answers, ~2-5 min total)
Don't worry there'll be plenty of time to follow up asyncrhonuously with those most interested)

**Option b: Still figuring out my project**
- Tell us where you're at with the project (1sec - 2 min)
- Is there any specific aspect you'd like to get feedback on (2-3 min)
- Time for feedback and questions (fairly short questions and answers, ~2-5 min total)
Don't worry there'll be plenty of time to follow up asyncrhonuously with those most interested)


While a milestone we're working toward is the 6th Gitcoin grants round, the bigger picture is to foster a community peer group.
This is great opportunity to cultivate group of fellow cryptopreneurs to be your long term projects' supporters and we will certainly have more programs to support you through.
