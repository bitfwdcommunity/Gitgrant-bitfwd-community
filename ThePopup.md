### The Popup - Season Two

Hot off a successful [Pilot](https://www.daorecords.org/the-popup-season-one-recap/ "Season One Recap"), we are back for Season Two of The Popup - 5 Episodes of our Art & Music show hosted by [DAOrecords](https://www.daorecords.org/ "Official Website") summoner Vandal that will take place on a weekly basis in the 3D virtual world known as [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/161 "Proposed Location").

Each Episode will feature 5 stellar musical pieces complete with limited edition collectibles, exclusively designed by a visual artist collaborator and available for purchase online and at the venue. Season Two will feature a total of 25 musicians & 5 visual artists!

With the arrival of limited edition Audio NFTs, we are very excited to add them to our collection of NFTs available in the upcoming Season Two of the Popup!

Pioneering the space, DAOrecords is on a mission to democratize the Music Industry through adoption of decentralized web technology. We invite you to join us on our journey of empowering communities worldwide through music, art and culture.

Proceeds of this grant will be amalgamated with the proceeds of the [previous round](https://gitcoin.co/grants/542/tunedao) and will help us amplify The Popup Season Two and further support participating artists and the DAO.

We all need a little fun and music in our lives, so come along and join us in Cryptovoxels for the next episode of The Popup!
