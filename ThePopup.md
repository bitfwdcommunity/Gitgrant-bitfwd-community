## DAOrecords is proud to present: 

The Popup - Season Two

Hot off a successful Pilot, we are back for Season Two of The Popup - 5 Episodes of our Art & Music show hosted by DAOrecords founder Vandal that will take place on a fortnightly basis in the 3D virtual world known as Cryptovoxels.

Each Episode will feature 5 stellar musical pieces complete with limited edition collectibles, exclusively designed by a visual artist collaborator and available for purchase online and at the venue. The season will feature a total of 25 musicians & 5 visual artists!

With limited edition audio NFTs on their way soon, we are very excited to add them to our collection of NFTs on sale in the upcoming Season Two of the Popup!

Pioneering the space, DAOrecords is on a mission to democratize the Music Industry through adoption of decentralized web technology. We invite you to join us on our journey of empowering communities worldwide through music, art and culture.

Proceeds of this grant will be amalgamated with the proceeds of the previous round and will help us amplify The Popup Season Two and further support participating artists.

We all need a little fun and music in our lives, so come along and join us in Cryptovoxels for the next episode of The Popup!


To note: We will include hyperlinks to the post-mortum of Season One once it's wrapped, showcasing this "pilot" season, how it went down and demonstrating the model. There will also be a few other things coming that will be added in before the Gitcoin Grant date, including the MintTape Release party and DAOrecords store in Cryptovoxels
