## DAOrecords is proud to present: 

The Popup - Season Two

Hot off a successful Pilot, we are back for Season Two of The Popup - 5 Episodes of our Art & Music show hosted by DAOrecords founder Vandal that will take place on a bi-weekly basis in the 3D virtual world known as Cryptovoxels.

Each show features 5 stellar musical pieces complete with limited edition collectibles, exclusively designed by our visual artist collaborator and available for purchase Online and at the venue. 

With limited edition audio NFTs on their way soon, we are very excited to include them with our collection of NFTS on sale in the upcoming Season Two of the Popup!

Pioneering the space, DAOrecords is on a mission to democratize the Music Industry through adoption of decentralized web technology. We invite you to join us on our journey of empowering communities worldwide through music, art and culture.

Proceeds of this grant will be amalgamated with the proceeds of the previous round and will help us amplify The Popup Season Two and further support participating artists.

We all need a little fun and music in our lives, so come along and join us in Cryptovoxels for the next episode of The Popup!
