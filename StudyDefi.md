# Problem Definition

Developing on DeFi and interacting with existing protocols (like Maker, Compound, Uniswap) is very difficult. Each protocol has its own interface and conventions, and knowledge on how to work with them is often hidden away. This knowledge gap is what drove us to create the StudyDeFi community, which consists of a [blog](https://studydefi.com), a Discord [server](discord.gg/rBr3U32), an NPM [package](https://github.com/studydefi/money-legos), and a [reference guide](https://money-legos.studydefi.com) for developers to rapidly develop on top of existing DeFi protocols.

# Stakeholder Roles and Outcomes

This project is created by Adrian Li from [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) and Kendrick Tan from [OmiseGO](https://omisego.co/) to help dapp developers in the Ethereum DeFi community work with the protocols (i.e. money-legos) that exist today. The goal is to help move the ecosystem forward by making it easier to build on top of these existing protocols so we can accelerate adoption and usage of DeFi and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

# Value Proposition

As mentioned above, we have published an NPM package called [Money-Legos](https://github.com/studydefi/money-legos), which we see as a public good. This package gives you the ABIs, addresses, and Solidity interfaces of major DeFi protocols at your finger tips. This means you no longer need to be Googling and copy and pasting this information anymore.

Beyond that, we have tutorials on [forking off Mainnet](https://studydefi.com/forking-off-mainnet/) and [testing with Mainnet state](https://studydefi.com/testing-on-mainnet/) that shows developers the fastest way to interact with DeFi protocols.

And finally, come join us on our Discord [server](discord.gg/rBr3U32) where we developers can ask experts about forking from Mainnet, working with existing DeFi protocols, and DeFi in general.

# Running Activities, Activities Pending Resourcing

We are currently planning a series of blog posts and webinars to help developers build on DeFi. The more money we raise means that we can contribute more time in creating useful content for DeFi developers everywhere. We also plan to write more tutorials on how to build on popular DeFi protocols. At this stage, it would be great to form alliances with others in the industry as well as encourage more participation from the open source community. Please try out [Money-Legos](https://money-legos.studydefi.com/) and see if it saves you development time.

# Next step on the roadmap.

Perhaps the most exciting thing is doing webinars on how to work with Maker, Uniswap, Compound, run tests on Mainnet and more! We hope that we're able to continue building our community on Discord. Please come say hi: https://discord.gg/rBr3U32
