# Problem Definition

Developing on DeFi and interacting with existing protocols (like Maker, Compound, Uniswap, flash loans) is very difficult. Each protocol has its own interface and conventions, and knowledge on how to work with them is often hidden away. This knowledge gap is what drove us to create a community called StudyDeFi.

# Stakeholder Roles and Outcomes

Created by Adrian Li from [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) and Kendrick Tan from [OmiseGO](https://omisego.co/) to help dapp developers in the Ethereum DeFi community work with DeFi protocols. The goal is to help move the DeFi and Ethereum ecosystems forward by making it easier to build on top of these "money-legos".

# Value Proposition

Tooling, Blog, Community.

1. We have published an NPM package called [Money-Legos](https://github.com/studydefi/money-legos), which we see as a public good and encourage the community to contribute. This package gives you the ABIs, addresses, and Solidity interfaces of major DeFi protocols at your finger tips (with Typescript autocomplete!). This means you no longer need to be Googling and copy and pasting anymore.

2. We also have a [blog](http://studydefi.com/) with tutorials like [forking off Mainnet](https://studydefi.com/forking-off-mainnet/) and [testing with Mainnet state](https://studydefi.com/testing-on-mainnet/) and more. We show developers the fastest way to interact with DeFi protocols like swapping tokens on Uniswap or reading the MakerDAO Medianizer.

3. Finally, come join us on our Discord [server](discord.gg/rBr3U32) where developers can ask experts about forking from Mainnet, working with existing DeFi protocols, and DeFi in general.

# Running Activities, Activities Pending Resourcing

We are planning more blog posts and live webinars to help developers build on DeFi. The more money we raise means we can create more useful content for DeFi developers everywhere. At this stage, it would be great to form alliances with others in the industry who are building on top of DeFi and the greater open source community. Please try out [Money-Legos](https://money-legos.studydefi.com/) and see if it saves you development time.

# Next steps

Perhaps the most exciting thing is our upcoming webinars on how to work with Maker, Uniswap, Compound, run tests on Mainnet and more! Please come say hi and let us know what you want to see: https://discord.gg/rBr3U32
