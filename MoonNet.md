If you answer each question in the guidance cards below with two sentences of roughly 10 to 15 words you will have 400-600 words and that's all you need:)

Please have a read of all the cards before you start writing:)

This is not an academic assignment, so keep it light and enjoy sharing with your reader:)



# Origin Story/ Problem Definition

    An origin story is a nice way to connect with the 
    reader. A narrative of some of the circumstances of your project’s inception and early stages, invites the reader to share in the motivations that got the founders fired-up in the first place.

    This approach works well for projects developing new tech, facilitating growth, creating opportunity and simulating business.

    Problem definition is when you define the problem that you project  solves. Every project ultimately offers a solution, but telling the story of the problem your project seeks to solve is a very good way to invite the reader to put themselves in the shoes of the people who will benefit form the fruits of your project's labor.

    This approach works well for projects making social, political or environmental impact as well as those supporting communities, nurturing nascent organizations and designing governance models.

While developing out our DApp [dedge.exchange](https://dedge.exchange), we encountered a lot of friction, knowledge gaps, and "gotchas". This ultimately caused us to lose a lot of development time, and noticed a lot of other developers were facing a similar problem as well. And so we decided to launch MoonNet to help streamline the developer experience for building out Defi protocols.




# Origin story questions:

    How was the idea born?
When we faced huge friction whilst developing out dedge.exchange

    What made it seem important at the time?
No one else was doing it

    What connected the founders before this project? 
We met at techstars and have bonded over a variety of topics such as functional programming, blockchain, and hiking.

    How did the project evolve to become the project that it is today?
Through repeated customer feedback and iteration


# Problem definition questions:

    What’s going on that isn’t right?
Developing on DeFi protocols today is tough

    How does it come about and what does it lead to?
We can make it less tough

    How did the founders discover the problem?
While we were trying to build our own defi dapp that integrates with other protocols.

    How do they aim to solve it?
By streamlining the developer experience, so they can go from zero to dapp development ina  few minutes without worrying about infrastructure.


# Stakeholder Roles and Outcomes

This part is about people and how they interact with your project. Anyone the project touches is a stakeholder. Although you will know best who your stakeholders really are, but the reader does not, so say a few words about:

    Your team
Kendrick Tan, Software Engineer; Adrian Li, Biz Dev

    Your community
DApp developers (DeFi specific)

    Your benefactors
DApp developers, and the users of the dapps built by said developers

The stakeholder group that will be impacted by your project the most - your biggest stakeholder

    Your most impactful stakeholder group
The Ethereum community as a whole


# Value Proposition

This is where you tell the reader about whatever it is that your project hopes to deliver. This part is all about your product/ your vision/ values you hope to build an organisation around/ and what it is that your project has to offer.

    What are you building?
Infrastructure to help streamline Defi Dapp development

    What does your project seek to accomplish? 
Help Defi Dapp developers go from zero to defi integration in a few minutes (not days).

    How will it solve the problem?
With some complicated infrastructure

    How will it impact a greater community?
Allow people to iterate, and test their protocols faster


# Running Activities, Activities Pending Resourcing

Now let's talk about what you have and what you need.

    Where are you up to on your roadmap?
We're currently focusing finding the right product market fit and will slowly iterate on that

    What would you do if you raised enough from this grant?
We will work on the project full-time

    Are you seeking alliances/ talent/ mentors?  
Yes, all 3 - alliance/talent/mentors

# Next step on the roadmap.

Your project is awesome and the reader will likely follow it’s socials, become a stakeholder, or know one and they will need something to talk about. So let's give them something to talk about, something to look out for and something they can take part in by funding you!

    What’s next and when is it coming?
There's a ton on the roadmap, but right now we're focusing on user 

    Do you have a funding target you must reach before you can start the next stage?
TBA

    What happens if you raise way more than you expected? 
TBA

    What awesome things will you do with the additional resources?
