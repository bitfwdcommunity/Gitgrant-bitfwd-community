# Origin Story/ Problem Definition 

ExtremeInsureMe was first conceived in 2013 when Jesse was unable to find life cover that would provide him with insurance that would take car of his family if something went wrong when he was racing his car. Jesse and Matthew had worked together previously at a high growth start-up called SMX which Jesse started 10+ years ago.
Matthew loves to be in nature, in 2017 he travelled to Mexico to go kitesurfing in Los Barriles, in 2018 he rode a Mountain bike over the Alps from Tegernsee in German through Austria to Lake Garda in Italy and in 2019 he learnt to Freedive in Timor Leste. Through this he learnt that it was easier to find exclusions for insurance then inclusions, everytime he did something fun it wasn’t covered and this caused him concern as a father.
In 2019 Matthew was accepted into the Edmund Hillary Fellowship, where he met Daniel Bar, they realised they were both the disruptive types and started collaborating on Alchemy DAOStack projects. Matthew and Daniel are in the EHF Kopakopa cohort together; Daniel runs the bitfwd Crypto Community ventures network and is a global nomad.
We decided to use crypto assets as a way to fully decentralise the back end and front end for a new way to manage risk when you live your fullest life. Here we come to take on the big boys who don’t trust you when you make a claim and haven’t thought accurately about the real support that is needed when you're away from home.

# Problem definition questions:

In the last two decades, there has been a major increase in both the popularity and participation in Extreme Sports and Global Adventure Travel.
As COVID-19 ends we expect people to live an even more extreme life, bigger parties, more travel and generally living life to the fullest as they become aware of how fragile life can be.
Most insurance policies are hard to read and have exclusions for altitude, water sports, motor sports, racing and competitions.
Though high risk, athletes take calculated risks and value life, death is infrequent.
Blockchain technology provides an opportunity for participants not traditionally eligible for the insurance coverage to use decentralized trust and autonomous processing smart contract capability of blockchains to self-insure the group by sharing risk at a reduced cost.
The early stage of Blockchain and cryptocurrency means the market is littered with failed attempts to commercialise the technology without a sound business model and focused on the technology, not the end user.
Our goal is to bridge the gap between non crypto users and to educate the market about the benefits of a DAO via a practical use case that addresses an existing need.

# Stakeholder Roles and Outcomes

The ExtremeDAO is designed for people who take the road less travelled. You love the adrenaline kick of adventures but don’t want to leave your family with a burden if the worst case happens. Matthew rides a sSkateboard to work at 49km (30miles) per hour. Some of us are born to take risks.
It’s impossible for extreme sports athletes to find cover easily for sports like Base Jumping or SkyDiving. Most insurance packages limit policy cover to 2,500m so rule out trekking and mountain biking through Nepal or the Alps. Basic travel insurances exclude watersports and open water activities, so KiteSurfing and Offshore Sailing are out. Racing and competitive sports, often the reason for travel are prohibited.
To access insurance cover for these types of risk, multiple add ons are required for special packages which rack up high costs for consumers. The whole process of finding the appropriate cover is difficult and rarely does it meet all of your needs, athletes often will have areas where they don’t have a cover and choose not to extend this because it only is required for 5 hours during their trip. We believe our initial DAO offer will appeal to backpackers and fully independent travelers and adventure athletes that are looking for long-stay travel insurance, though due to ease of use and segment size we expect early adopters to be in the single trip category, people are are searching for sports or travel health travel cover POSTCovid.

# Value Proposition

We’re all based in NZ currently and we see an opportunity where NZ continues to be the adventure capital of the world, but instead of shying away from the real risk of adventure sports we build communities to support each other in times of need. Extreme aims to build a community, not a financial service so that when you have your greatest need the community is there to support you.
But the real opportunity here is far wider. Policies are not written in plain English. When you ask consumers what they think about their insurance company, people rank them as one of the most hated industries behind pay TV and telecommunications.
If we get the model right on this tightly defined use case we can open the model to communities in much greater need. This idea isn’t about building a financial service. The aim is to introduce resilience into communities through an even distribution of risk and commitment to help others when they really need it.
We don't need legislation to enforce trust and reputation when the system is fully transperant and trust and reputation are built into the design.

# Running Activities, Activities Pending Resourcing

The inital aim is to create a simple to use fully decentralised cover that offers a $25,000 USD payout upon accidental death (subject to funds in the DAO). This amount is sufficient to return the body to a family, cover funeral costs and any travel required from any location in the world.
Its black and white claims process and one of the most profitable insurance products. #ripoff
The current model includes a broker, insurance provider, the reinsurance provider. Ultimately the risk owner is far removed from the actual risk, what if your cover was fully automated, completely transparent and community managed?
For $25USD a month payable in ETH (or Fiat via an exchange) and we’ll hold the value of the fund in an escrow account stored in a smart contract. Effectively users retain their own funds in the pool, less a % fee paid to ExtremeInsureMeDAO which covers the cost of operations and technology R&D.
Non crypto users will be enabled to purchase the cover via a monthly payment on their credit card, the community will provide support for the use of metamask to on-board them to the DAO.
In the case of a claim event, the amount is paid to the claimant based on a % of that customer's tokens to their nominated beneficiaries.
At any time the user can sell their tokens and effectively cash out the policy, less the fee paid that we take of top to set this up.
The claims process will be transparent and managed via a DAO.
If you are interested in the DAO, please join us, because we have work to do in decentralising the claims process. We need a crypto community to help design this to be simple to understand and you can fund us or join us, even sharing what we’re working on will provide people with an understanding that there is a new way to do things.

# Next step on the roadmap.

The help we need now is to integrate the off the shelf subscription platform with a crypto payment API and the MetaMask AP and Alchemy.
We need about $2,500USD for each integration as we’re using an off the shelf open ERP called Odoo for the beta which we’re hosting on our own servers.
From this campaign we aim to raise $10,000 to create a small fund for a developer to leverage existing APIs to mostly automate the service. The minimum we need to raise to have a meaningful impact is $2,500USD.
1. CreditCard to Crypto API
2. MetaMask Wallet API
3. AlchemyDAO Claims Process
4. EtherScan API integration into Odoo Accounting Module
We have found a potential developer and are working on the architure to ensure we can secure the movement for crypto assets.
If you like the concept and want to contribute a significant amount we would build a difi wallet. At this stage we are use low cost building blocks to test and validate the concept, once we’ve prove it we’ll reassess the project and determine if we’ll seek additional funds or use the DAO model to cash flow fund the ongoing build so it can remain fully decentralised and open source.
We already have a lot of interest in the DAO from friends and family, both crypto and non-crypto users who we will help manually onboarding to the DAO. We have a lot of people waiting for us to launch subscription platform so we know we have $9,000 - $10,000 towards the initial policy through verbal commitments.
We are working through the way we’ll use NFT and Bonding curves.
We'd love you suppoort and thanks for taking the time to read about what we are working on.
