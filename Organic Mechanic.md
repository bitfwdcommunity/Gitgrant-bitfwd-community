Organic Mechanic is a New Zealand-owned and operated organic and medicinal food manufacturer, distributor and community hub. 

Since its establishment in 2013 Organic Mechanic’s mission has been to promote community access to sustainably grown and manufactured nutritionally sound food.

From market stalls to stores, from smoothies to kombucha, hemp seeds and adaptogenic blends, from art and community festivals to online purchase and home delivery - Organic Mechanic tasks itself with connecting consumers with conscientious food manufacturers, strengthening local food networks and reinventing food sovereignty.

In association with bitfwd and our friends at the Edmund Hillary Foundation Organic Mechanic seeks to establish a globally impactful decentralized community united for the cause of democratizing food and empowering nutritional independence and conscientious sustainable farming and food manufacturing practices.

We seek both talent and resources for the development  of ”Food Web DAO“- a decentralized organization which will serve as a digital common supporting harmonious interdependency of producers and consumers.

Proceeds of this grant will be used to supply organic plant-based foods to people who may not be able to afford them. 

Join us and be the change you want to see!
