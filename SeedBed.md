Background

After working in China and Africa, and digging deeper and deeper in to theory of economy. Tomer Bariach the CEO and founder of SeedBed came to the conclusion that the capitalism in its current form does not serve the original essence or stands to its promise to create a better life.

In fact the way we measure economic growth now days does not mean disappearance of poverty or rise in personal well being but rather a rise of consumption and rearrangement of poverty.

Listening to bernard lietaer lecture - Tomer become obsessed with money not with the concept of accumulating it but to the thought process of what money is, how can it be that something that man made is missing for billions of people around, not land, not food, not labour time but money? that’s where the idea of new kind of economy rose, one that drives growth by a community ability and values to operate as an thriving independent economical organizem.

This kind of economy has been waiting exactly for blockchain technology that will allow enough experimenting and innovating in order to break rooted economical paradigm.

If money is man-made and it’s failing to fulfill it’s utility — can we allow people to create new money? Could this help people reimagine the socio-economic environment they live in?
We think it can. We believe that by providing the right tools to create a community token, anyone can encourage local growth. Local populations can turn their communities into economies, and it’s something every person can do. Just like Wix did to websites, and Facebook to forums.
Mission

The goal of SeedBed is to give people who live in inefficient economies a platform where they can create new standards for collaboration and exchange value in more niche ways that fit their communities, values, and way of life.

SeedBed is a self-service community token creation platform it was originally  based on saving  saving group model that but soon after grow to a full scale of new community economy-SeeBed model.

Our model- the token model is “Proof of Stake” (POS) — where people are rewarded for the money they save and contribute to a community pool that can be used for loans or joint business, while bringing more stability to the community token.

Team

Once Tomer realized the calling behind his idea, it was clear to him that he ready to go on a new journey with his two of his former colleagues in the blockchain field, both of whom carry the flag of empowering communities and pushing to their independence in different fields from indigenous culture through gender and finally inventing new economy model that will perfectly fit the communities behaviour and needs.

What have we done so far?
At the moment we have  developed the smart contracts that will support our model and we are now working on our native app that will  be super easy and user friendly to the fact that even non technological user will be able to set and manage his economy and his community.

Our product, unlike many of the blockchain products available in the market, is very easy to use and almost transparent to end-user blockchain technology.
What will we do with the money

Our next stage will be developing a self creation ability for any user- meaning every user will be able to create his currency with the settings that are relevant to his community only in 3 extremely simple steps on our native app- this grant will help us to achieve to one of our goal in its give full independence to our communities from the very beginning, which will give us the ability to reach a much wider audience of communities.

Target

our funding target at the moment is set to 25,000, so we can get to the target listed above.
